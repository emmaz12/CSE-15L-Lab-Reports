This week, we worked on using git commands as well as shortcuts to speed up our typing in terminal. In doing so, we did a competiion where we competed to see how fast we were to complete a series of steps. The steps for the competition are below:

1. Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
