Introduction

In this lab report, I will be recreating the tasks from Lab Report 4. I especially liked this lab report since we worked on learning how to better use commands in a more efficient manner. Within this lab, however, I will be creating a bash script that will automatically reproduce all the steps within Lab Report 4. This should be definitely faster than the steps shown in Lab 4!
